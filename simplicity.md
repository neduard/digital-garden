# Why I like simple things

## TL;DR

We are finite beings living in a finite universe.  To simplify means to reduce.  Reducing allows space for new things.  There are many concepts linking to this, for example:
  * the ([perhaps](https://web.archive.org/web/20230127001315/https://indico.cern.ch/event/868940/contributions/3814076/attachments/2082851/3498698/Melo.pdf) outdated?) idea of [elegance in Physics](https://archive.org/details/TheMoralityOfFundamentalPhysicsNimaArkaniHamedCornellUniversity1080p30fpsH264128kbitAAC) where we have been able to explain [more and more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory) of our universe using (in a certain sense) "simpler and simpler" descriptions.
  * the [connection](https://web.archive.org/web/20231013031853/http://prize.hutter1.net/) between intelligence and the ability to compress (i.e. reduce)

I also work in software.  There we have the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle#Variants) principle.  Despite that, a lot of software is [bloated](http://spinroot.com/gerard/pdf/Code_Inflation.pdf).  Much of modern software engineering is less about designing algorithms and more about [integrating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) different components and managing the resulting complexity.

Simplicity is one of the reasons I keep a [word-count](index.html#word-count) on this site.  It keeps things bounded and hence it forces me to think what is actually important.

## Intelligence
Simplicity requires work.

## Software

I think it's linked with working in software.  Fundamentally, software is about reducing (i.e. abstracting over) complexity.  Anything you can do on a computer you can do with [pen and paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) - the only difference is orders of magnitude of speedup.

In software Many [admire complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBE6glZNJuU) (round 19:00 timestamp, also tangent link to [hommage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY33uoBSw3w)) and this is [visible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6XQUciI-Sc)
